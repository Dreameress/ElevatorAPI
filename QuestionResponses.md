Most real systems combine all three: IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service) for custom infrastructure, PaaS  (Platform as a Service) for custom code, and SaaS (Software as a Service) for commonly used apps like email or CRM. Examples incldue Azure VM for IAAS, Azure Functions or Azure SQL Database as PAAS,
